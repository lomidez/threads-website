@page
@model ErrorModel
<!-- 
    This allows the Razor view to access the properties and methods of the 'ErrorModel' class.
-->
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Error";
}
<!--
    The ViewData dictionary is used to store data that will be available in the view. 
    Here, it sets the title of the page to "Error", which will be used by the layout file (if it exists) or displayed in the title tag of the page.
-->

<h1 class="text-danger">Error.</h1>
<!--
    This is the main heading for the error page. It uses the 'text-danger' Bootstrap class to display the text in a red color.
-->

<h2 class="text-danger">An error occurred while processing your request.</h2>
<!--
    This is a secondary heading that provides a general message indicating that an error occurred. 
    It also uses the 'text-danger' class to make the message red.
-->

@if (Model.ShowRequestId)
{
    <p>
        <strong>Request ID:</strong> <code>@Model.RequestId</code>
    </p>
    <!-- 
        If 'ShowRequestId' is true in the model, it displays the Request ID of the error.
        The 'RequestId' helps to track the error in log files or debugging.
    -->
}

<h3>Development Mode</h3>
<!-- 
    A third-level heading indicating the section about "Development Mode". This is meant to provide guidance on enabling development features for debugging.
-->

<p>
    Swapping to the <strong>Development</strong> environment displays detailed information about the error that occurred.
</p>
<!--
    This paragraph explains that enabling the "Development" environment shows detailed error information.
-->

<p>
    <strong>The Development environment shouldn't be enabled for deployed applications.</strong>
    It can result in displaying sensitive information from exceptions to end users.
    For local debugging, enable the <strong>Development</strong> environment by setting the <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</strong> environment variable to <strong>Development</strong>
    and restarting the app.
</p>
<!-- 
    This paragraph provides important advice: the "Development" environment should not be used in production because it exposes sensitive error details to the user. 
    For local debugging, it suggests enabling "Development" by setting the 'ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT' variable.
